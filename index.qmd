# Welcome to Persistent Task Lists

This demo shows how task lists can maintain their checked/unchecked state even when you:

1. Refresh the page
2. Navigate away and come back
3. Close the browser and return later

## Try it out!

Check or uncheck some of these tasks:

- [ ] Task 1: Read the documentation
- [ ] Task 2: Try checking and unchecking this item
- [ ] Task 3: Refresh the page and see if your changes persist
- [ ] Task 4: Visit another page and come back

## How it works

This extension uses browser localStorage to save the state of task checkboxes. Each page has its own set of saved states, so tasks on different pages can be managed independently.

The localStorage data is specific to your browser on this device, so other users or your sessions on other devices will see the default (unchecked) state.
